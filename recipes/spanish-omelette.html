    <h2><b>Description</b></h2>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Eggs</b>
            <ul>
                <li>The amount will depend on the size of the omelette. Probably between 4 and 6.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li><b>Potatoes</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Peeled and thinly sliced</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li><b>Oil</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Olive oil will give you a healthy and tasty tortilla but sunflower oil is fine and much cheaper</li>
            </ul></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large amount of oil to a medium heat in a deep frying pan.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced and peeled potatoes and cook slowly until soft</li>
        <li>Drain the oil</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs</li>
        <li>add to the potatoes, ensuring they are mixed well</li>
        <li>flip the omelette with the help of a plate</li>
        <li>cook on a mlow-medium heat until done</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>ATTENTION!</strong> <em>The idea is to cook the potatoes gently until soft - NOT to fry to a crisp!</em></p>
